# extend-types-go
This package supports your object-oriented programming.
extend-types-go provides extended objects inheriting from built-in types and a list of extended slices.

Extended objects are immutable objects, and implemented methods are non-destructive.
They implement typecast methods and several utility methods, reducing the need to define your own value objects of the underlying type.

list is a defined type of slice that uses generics and implements a set of methods based on Ruby Array.

# Contributing
This was originally an implementation for myself, but I am currently in the process of experimentally releasing it as OSS.
I am a beginner in OSS development, and there may be various insufficient elements.
So contributions are most welcome.
